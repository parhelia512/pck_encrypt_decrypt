TODO:

DONE-investigate the equivalent in Windows environment. For example, find the commands in Windows Power Shell that does:
 DONE-Base64 encode/decode
 DONE-rev - to reverse a string
 DONE-tr - to replace contents of ascii texts with 2 character sequences
DONE-consider to combine and encrypt/decode multiple tags in one go
-consider to put in proper encryption such as gpg or openssl
DONE-add salt to the tag mode encryption so that the same text will be enrypted to different results
-in linux version (pck_encrypt_decrypt.sh), encryption (mode 'encf') seems to always append a line to the end; for windows version, it doesn't append a line to the end
 this caused the resulting file different in the encrypted version, although when decrypting, they seems to become identical file again.

some commands that are useful:

-to get the md5 checksum of a file on windows powershell:
Get-FileHash <filepath> -Algorithm MD5

-to compare two files on windows powershell:
diff (cat <file1) (cat <file2>)
