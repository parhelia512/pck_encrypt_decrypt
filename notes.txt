TODO:

-consider to put in proper encryption such as gpg or openssl
-in linux version (pck_encrypt_decrypt.sh), encryption (mode 'encf') seems to always append a line to the end; for windows version, it doesn't append a line to the end
 this caused the resulting file different in the encrypted version, although when decrypting, they seems to become identical file again.
-feature: filename encrypt
-feature: header encrypt, i.e. encrypt the first 100 bytes
-all enci mode to have an optional tag, so that the encrypted text is already enclosed in tag
-in dec mode with tag, if the password is wrong, it outputs the orginal line with the decrypted content empty, it should output an error instead
-for decrypt, if tag not found, got error "Invalid character in input stream.", should make it more user friendly such as "tag not found"
-enhance to handle multiple lines of encryption tags, instead of just 1 line
DONE(win v0.4)-port the latest features from .sh to .ps1
DONE(win v1.0)-update the version to v1.0, plus minor fix
-BUG for win version, chinese characters seem cannot be encrypted/decrypted with tags 

some commands that are useful:

-to get the md5 checksum of a file on windows powershell:
Get-FileHash <filepath> -Algorithm MD5

-to compare two files on windows powershell:
diff (cat <file1>) (cat <file2>)

----------------------------------------------------
DONE:

DONE(v1.8)-enhance to use pbcopy; for the read from stdin option, add an option to use pbcopy to copy to clipboard (i.e. like using ctrl-c)
DONE(v1.9)-put in password length and character limit check
DONE(v1.10)-further deviate the encryption by multiple encryption, prevent close enough password to be able to decrypt the encrypted text
DONE-add an option when decrypting and output to file, strip the file extension (i.e. get rid of the .encf instead of making the file .encf.decf)
DONE(v1.8)-read from stdin; command line option to directly put the string to encrypt/decrypted
DONE-investigate the equivalent in Windows environment. For example, find the commands in Windows Power Shell that does:
 DONE-Base64 encode/decode
 DONE-rev - to reverse a string
 DONE-tr - to replace contents of ascii texts with 2 character sequences
DONE-consider to combine and encrypt/decode multiple tags in one go
DONE-add salt to the tag mode encryption so that the same text will be enrypted to different results
DONE(v1.7)-for .sh; use something like line.substring() to search for tag_key_head and tag_key_tail, so that the encrypted tag can be inside the line, any drawback?
DONE(v1.8)-enhance to use pbcopy; for the read from stdin option, add an option to use pbcopy to copy to clipboard (i.e. like using ctrl-c)
DONE(v1.9)-put in password length and character limit check
DONE(v1.10)-further deviate the encryption by multiple encryption, prevent close enough password to be able to decrypt the encrypted text
