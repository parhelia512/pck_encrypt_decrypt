TODO:
DONE-add an option when decrypting and output to file, strip the file extension (i.e. get rid of the .encf instead of making the file .encf.decf)
-consider to put in proper encryption such as gpg or openssl
-in linux version (pck_encrypt_decrypt.sh), encryption (mode 'encf') seems to always append a line to the end; for windows version, it doesn't append a line to the end
 this caused the resulting file different in the encrypted version, although when decrypting, they seems to become identical file again.
-feature: filename encrypt
-feature: header encrypt, i.e. encrypt the first 100 bytes
DONE(v1.8)-read from stdin; command line option to directly put the string to encrypt/decrypted
-there are still some line break issues, i.e. when decrypt using .ps1 with a file encrypted by .sh
-for decrypt, if tag not found, got error "Invalid character in input stream.", should make it more user friendly such as "tag not found"
DONE(v1.8)-enhance to use pbcopy; for the read from stdin option, add an option to use pbcopy to copy to clipboard (i.e. like using ctrl-c)
DONE(v1.9)-put in password length and character limit check
DONE(v1.10)-further deviate the encryption by multiple encryption, prevent close enough password to be able to decrypt the encrypted text
-enhance to handle multiple lines of encryption tags, instead of just 1 line

some commands that are useful:

-to get the md5 checksum of a file on windows powershell:
Get-FileHash <filepath> -Algorithm MD5

-to compare two files on windows powershell:
diff (cat <file1) (cat <file2>)

----------------------------------------------------
DONE:

DONE-investigate the equivalent in Windows environment. For example, find the commands in Windows Power Shell that does:
 DONE-Base64 encode/decode
 DONE-rev - to reverse a string
 DONE-tr - to replace contents of ascii texts with 2 character sequences
DONE-consider to combine and encrypt/decode multiple tags in one go
DONE-add salt to the tag mode encryption so that the same text will be enrypted to different results
DONE(v1.7)-for .sh; use something like line.substring() to search for tag_key_head and tag_key_tail, so that the encrypted tag can be inside the line, any drawback?
