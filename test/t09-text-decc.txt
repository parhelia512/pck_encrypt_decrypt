1) decrypt this file with decc mode on tag <en.2>:
test/t09-text-decc.txt

with this password:
orangeBird

i.e.
$ ./pck_encrypt_decrypt.sh test/t09-text-decc.txt decc en.2

The results should be that only the first tag <en.2> is being decrypted and copied to clipboard

The encrypted text here should be "It is 19-2-2024 today". <en.1>5661-KCuocyDzMNBHHW2oGxd3/yPoEYDOKwBYLDdarYH6QxlNcgLlKEdajC9wK6BRjAcluYc9D3sFGyBSEWkzAWHUDvXVAYcAcg20Gyk3Av+zSeDMjFDALWuWcELzLXceHgBXAClUDFDVK5cNcePWdeLxdwDaJAvQ</en.1> This is the end
The encrypted text here should be "iAmHappyYesterday-18/2/2024". <en.2>4841-kCV/O48+zNrUkoVnKaDSVCpUKauUiF5aKEuOU48+AF5WzMJLkMJVOOrVf3JHLnVqLMVNJ4A6ADxqJ25NAaujIMpUKoDGLOxKkMd1M/m=</en.2> This is the end
The encrypted text here should be "HowAboutTomorrow:20 Feb, 2024?". <en.2>1351-P5EMOOj+wOwGR3zQOJbUXoucRI4RRfK0Q4uQO44+Y9uTRfO5QcTISMwRKOWMP5epPNWTpObUwI0YQIWKRG0uhO41R9ulhH5+wI0oSI0+W4uVXcuvRHAFRP/VX4OLhIX/w9oipO40wOSXQQb2pcoZtcw9UQJZ</en.2> This is the end

2) All tags in this file is encrypted with the same password as stated above (you may verify by decrypting them all using mode "dec"), 
 this test demonstrated the usage of mode "decc",
 and that it will only match the 1st tag matched and copy to clipboard
